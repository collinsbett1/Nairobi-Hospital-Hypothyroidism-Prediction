# Nairobi-Hospital-Hypothyroidism-Prediction
## a) Specifying the Question
Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

## b) Defining the Metric for Success
The accuracy of our models should be above 85% for the project to be declared a success.

## c) Understanding the context
Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) occurs when your thyroid gland produces too much of the hormone thyroxine. Hyperthyroidism can accelerate your body's metabolism, causing unintentional weight loss and a rapid or irregular heartbeat.

Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. It is this data that will be used to create machine learning models that will help predict if a patient's symptoms indicate they suffer from hyperthyroidism.

## d) Experimental Design
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Cleaning
3. Univariate Analysis
4. Bivariate Analysis
5. Modelling;
*  Decision Trees: Random Forests , Ada Boosted Trees , Gradient Boosted Trees
* b. Support Vector Machines: Kernel = polynomial , linear , rbf

6. Conclusion
